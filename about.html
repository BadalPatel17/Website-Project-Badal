      Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock
      across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common
      forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles"
      (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor
      activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular
      indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the
      racquet and landing it within the other team's half of the court.

      Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the
      net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or ground, or if
      a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their
      absence) the opposing side.[1]

      The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile
      that flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In
      particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock
      to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed
      compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the
      shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.

      The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore
      and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the
      game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated
      by China. In 1992, badminton debuted as a Summer Olympic sport with four
      events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's
      doubles;[2] mixed doubles was added four years later. At high levels of
      play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic
      stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical
      sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of
      sophisticated racquet movements.[3]
